This is a small enhanced version of the playground appilcation created by Daniel Smilkov and Shan Carter.

https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.14647&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false

It was build for a study-project and added following features to the original playground:

  - Save function
  - Fix seed-value
  - New data-sets
  - New input-features
  - Extend the gradient descent algorithm with an momentum part
  
Feel free to clone the repository and play around with it!
